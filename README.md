# IoT Sentinel: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in IoT Networks

This project focuses on identifying anomalous network traffic within an Internet of Things (IoT) environment using unsupervised machine learning techniques. By training models exclusively on benign traffic from the **CIC-IoT-Dataset-2023**, we can build a baseline of "normal" behavior and flag any deviations as potential anomalies or threats.

The core of this project utilizes the **PyOD** library to train and evaluate three powerful outlier detection algorithms: **Isolation Forest (IForest)**, **ECOD**, and **COPOD**.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The primary goal is to create a system that can detect unusual network activity without prior knowledge of specific attack signatures. This approach is highly effective for discovering novel (zero-day) attacks.

**Workflow:**

1. **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:** Load network flow data, handle missing/infinite values, and standardize features.
2. **Unsupervised Model Training:** Train IForest, ECOD, and COPOD models on the clean, benign dataset.
3. **Analysis & Visualization:** Analyze the outlier scores generated by each model and visualize the results to understand model behavior.
4. **Artifact Generation:** Save the trained models, data scaler, and reports for future inference and reproducibility.
